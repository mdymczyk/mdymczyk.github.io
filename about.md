Strange Pole living in Tokyo, huge ramen and technology fan. This blog will most probably contain a mix of both.

I usually work with JVM related technologies (mainly using Java and Scala) on distributed computing and machine learning problems. It's not that I hate front end, it's the front end that hates me.

The blog is created using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on [github](https://github.com/) and edited using [prose.io](http://prose.io/).

The logo: it's simply one the Japanese [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) meaning strange/wisdom. If you know me personally then you probably know that the first meaning fits me perfectly and that I'm always striving for the latter meaning.

The cover photo: it's a picture of the [Meguro river](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meguro_River) during [hanami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanami). You should definitely check it out if you are in Japan around end of March.

The theme: since I'm extremely bad ad design and stuff I decided to go with the amazing [mediator theme](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator).
