<pre class="brush:java;"><br />class Welcome {<br />  public static void main(String[] args) {<br />    System.out.println("Hello, 世界!");<br />  }<br />}<br /></pre><br>Hello and welcome! It took me a bit longer than I initially planned (only around a few years longer) but finally I took the time to put together this blog. <br><br>Knowing me it will be rarely updated (you can find out about what I will be blogging in the About section), but hopefully I will be done with my first (real) entry in a few days. Stay tuned!
